In the field of remote network management, it's crucial to understand the complexities of various network protocols involved. Today, we’ll explore two fundamental protocols: Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH).

# Overview of each protocol

## Telnet protocol
**Definition:** Telnet (TELecommunication NETwork) is a protocol used to provide bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication via a virtual terminal connection.

**Purpose:** Telnet allows users to remotely control a computer over a network, making it a handy tool for network administrators.


**Key features:**
- Plaintext transmission: data is sent in plain text, making it easy to implement but insecure.
- Minimal overhead: simplistic design with minimal protocol overhead.
- Simple command structure: easy to use with straightforward commands.

**Typical use cases:**
- Remote management of devices: accessing network devices like routers and switches.
- Legacy systems access: managing older systems that do not support secure protocols.
- Network device configuration: quick changes and troubleshooting in secure environments.

## Secure shell (SSH) protocol
**Definition:** SSH (secure shell) is a protocol that provides secure command-line interface access over an unsecured network.

**Purpose:** SSH is designed to enable secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network, making it essential for modern network management.

**Key features:**

- Encrypted communication: ensures data is transmitted securely using encryption.
- Secure authentication: supports strong authentication methods.
- Robust command execution: allows secure command execution and file transfers.

**Typical use cases:**
- Secure remote administration: managing servers and network devices securely.
- Secure file transfers: using SCP (secure copy protocol) or SFTP (secure file transfer protocol).
- Encrypted communications: setting up secure tunnels for data transmission.
